Biography
=====
I am an MD–PhD student at the University of Helsinki (expected graduation 2027) with an interest in clinical epidemiology and evidence-based medicine. My research is mainly focused on estimating risks of thrombosis and bleeding in surgery and oncology,
but I also work on overdiagnosis, definitions of disease, and research methodology. I also hold a BSc in Mathematics from Aalto University (2024) and have studied philosophy at the University of Helsinki.

Beyond academics, in 2018–2021 I studied composition and music theory with a minor in piano at Sibelius Junior Academy
organized by the Sibelius Academy (University of the Arts Helsinki). Afterwards, I continued my studies in piano at the Espoo
Music Institute from 2021 to 2024. My music has been performed by Kymi Sinfonietta, St. Michel Strings (Mikkelin Kaupunginorkesteri),
and several smaller ensembles.
